# ResearchWiki---Research-Paper-Collection
This is an example of university work that aimed to demonstrate the creation of an API to display research papers and their relevant authors. It uses PHP to build up the API within the backend and features a React based front end to demonstrate use of the API with the use of aditional technologies such as Firebase and JSON web tokens.

This is university work and is not at all ascociated with the DIS conference. ResearchWiki is a fabricated name, and is used purely for thematics.
